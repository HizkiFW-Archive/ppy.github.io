I received a few emails recently asking why there were hold-ups with API bug fixes and improvements. Looking back at the commit log, it was quite apparently how forgotten the API has been in recent times, so I spent half a day going through the most active [issues](https://github.com/peppy/osu-api/issues?q=is%3Aissue+sort%3Aupdated-desc) and fixing what I could.

So why do things like this get "forgotten"? It's not like I'm purposely avoiding the API in this case. With the new osu!web in active development, it just doesn't make sense to continue adding new features to the old framework. But I get you â€“ completely abandoning something like the API can stall development for your external projects, and therefore I plan on committing more time to keeping the API offerings growing in the old framework until we have the new systems up and running.

Going forward, I plan to make the API offered for public access completely shared with the API used by the actual osu! site and game. This means that not only will there be less code paths for us to manage, but that third-party developers will be able to access (mostly) everything you can find in-game or on the official site. There will of course be some limitations in place where required for safety/privacy reasons, but I hope to make things as open as possible in a hope to foster some amazingly imaginative and useful additions to the osu! ecosystem.

So if you are a developer and have something you'd like to see added right now to the API, leave an issue on the above repo (make sure to search first to make sure it doesn't already exist; if it does, add a comment with your purpose for the feature to give it more priority)!

Have a great weekend guys. I'll try and do either some streaming or Q&A over the weekend time-permissive, so keep a watch on twitter :).
