Today I spent almost the whole day debugging my new HTTP code to figure why the post body data is not sent when the request is over a certain size. I still have no idea why it isn't working. Some days you just try everything but it's not enough. If anyone feels like looking through my code, [be my guest](https://gist.github.com/peppy/cb502fa48631de0331e0) (find the problem before I do and I'll be eternally grateful).

In strangely related news, I also began introducing bounties to the osu!web project. This means that if you are willing to help us out by completing feature requests (or fixing bugs, as it may be) I will compensate you for your time. If this sounds interesting to you, check out the [bounty rewards list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jNXfj_S3Pb5PErA-czDdC9DUu4IgUbe1Lt8E7CYUJuE/edit#gid=332590607), and check the osu!web's [issues page](https://github.com/ppy/osu-web/issues) for current available tasks. Look for the bounty keyword, specifically :).

Any questions? Ask here in the comments and I'll do my best to clarify things.
