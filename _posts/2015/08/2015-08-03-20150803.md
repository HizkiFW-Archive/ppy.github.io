Recently I've been abusing Google Inbox to schedule distracting tasks from the week until the Monday of the week after, which makes Mondays into a kind of catch-up day. Hot weather continue in Tokyo, with mid-30s maximums (apparent temperature hits 43-45 due to the insane humidity levels) and not much of a break at night either.

A few brief updates:

* There's currently a [poll open](https://osu.ppy.sh/forum/t/353798) to choose which t-shirt designs should be produced next. Feel free to go vote if you haven't already, although the winners this round already seem to have been decided.

* Got some new arrivals to [jizz user profiles](http://jizz.ppy.sh/u/zallius), with user pages making a reappearance today and more to come likely tomorrow. Keep your eyes peeled!

* Making progress on the next osu!keyboard order (here's a [sneak peak](http://puu.sh/jnEsK/1153c92c10.png) of one of the changes we're making next batch). Doing business internationally can be a truly gruelling process; the last few days of follow-up just to get money where it needs to be have been quite exhausting.

As far as progress on the next osu! release goes, I've been spending a good part of my time merging in bug fixes that have been piling up over the last month. We still have a lot to fix, but part of getting things right is understanding exactly which users are experiencing problems, and whether those problems need to be fixed at our end or the user's end.
