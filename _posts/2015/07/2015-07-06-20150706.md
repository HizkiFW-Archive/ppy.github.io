Between continued work on fixing the remaining issues with the new draw hierachy and working through behind-the-scenes maintenance tasks, I find myself pretty tired by the end of a day. Then I realise I haven't written a blog post yet!

I guess I'll share with you what I got done today in a very raw fashion for a change! Enjoy some git logs :).

Hope everyone is having a productive start to the week. Here's my current background music of choice: some amazing [new age piano](https://michelemclaughlin.bandcamp.com/album/a-change-of-color) I came across while working from a cafe. Been enjoying some quieter music recently; I may have worn my ears out overdosing on [Zedd](https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/true-colors/id984316475) over the last couple of months ^^;.
