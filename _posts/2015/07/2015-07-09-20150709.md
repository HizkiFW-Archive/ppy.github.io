Made some more good progress on the tournament listing/registration system today. My desktop capture app is a bit broken so nothing to show, but you will see it soon enough as we open registrations for the next official mania world cup early next week! Also fixed a few more issues with the osu! client (combo bursts look correct again on the new draw system).

I had a couple of requests to make web-based audio previews use html5 audio rather than flash, and as someone recently linked me the horribly simple implementation to do so, they are now live on the current osu! web [beatmap listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/p/beatmaplist) â€“ just click a thumbnail. Youtube previews are also able to use html5 playback where possible, too. This should make the osu! site a 100% flash-free environment (which is great, considering the consistent stream of exploits found in flash)

osu! running on OS X natively is in a good state, and we are beginning to look at ensuring the update system works so we can do some public-faced testing.

Nice to see the occasional map come out which isn't focused purely on difficulty, has a good sense of rhythm, no overmapping and some really nicely suiting custom hit sounds. Check out [MAGIC! - Rude](https://osu.ppy.sh/s/297693) mapped by [XeroiZi HD](https://osu.ppy.sh/u/3597118) for a map that I can get behind :).
