* osu!tablet replacement pens are now [available](http://store.ppy.sh/store/product/37) from the store. I priced these at the absolute lowest price possible.
* nono keyboards are still a bit further away.
* Working on improvements to the support / ban appeal process. Nothing to announce yet, but this is an area I wish to see improvement in.
* Still not confident enough to release the new stable. Not even sure what the cause of the remaining issues are (really sucks trying to fix things you can't reproduce yourself).
* Switched from pingdom to statuscake. Not looking back. The osu! [status page](http://stat.ppy.sh) has changed slightly as a result.
* Almost got back to inbox zero. Is my goal for this weekend!
