Today marks the release of the first of many [large bounties](https://github.com/ppy/osu-web/issues/35) to come for osu!web. This is still new territory, and I don't want to set the bounty too low or too high, so let me know if you think the current offering is unreasonable in either direction. Also help out if that's something you are able to do! We are making great progress as a group since open-sourcing osu!web. Very good feedback on issues posted so far, and much more activity in general.

Fixed up qualified scores not actually being deleted when ranked today. Kind of an oversight – I thought I'd get around to implementing before the week past since I announced the change, but I've just been so busy that... oops ^^;

Got the new [pippi design t-shirts](http://store.ppy.sh/store/product/33) on the store. They look amazing and I can't wait to get my own. We went with a lighter fabric this time. According to my trusty osu!store helper, it feels much better than the last batch! The [triangles t-shirt design](http://store.ppy.sh/store/product/12) is also back in stock now.

Got an update on osu!keyboard production process. We have had some delays while sourcing custom keycaps – something I wanted added for the next batch – but everything is good and I reckon the result looks pretty amazing.

The actual boards are currently in manufacturing (cherry switches are being welded to the logic board). ETA is still at least a month away, but getting closer. At least we're ordering enough stock this time around that once they come in we shouldn't run out anytime soon!
