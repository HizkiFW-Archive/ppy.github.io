Some users were reporting loss of all connectivity since the new netcode in CE and beta. I added fallback support for cases where IPv6 isn't working correctly which should solve this issue. If it affected you, please give it another try. Apart from this, we're still hard at work trying to get the new stable release out.

So, what to do with recruiters who are just a bit too persistent? This guy [Tony Morris](http://puu.sh/knTwb/b6e22f2561.png) [insisted](http://puu.sh/knTwb/b6e22f2561.png) that he added me to his DNC list. Yet only two months later here I am hearing from him again.

fun fact #1: If you take a close look at his messages, you can see some sloppy copy-paste format mismatches.

fun fact #2: he also contact other people I employ with the same email. maybe he'd be interested in buying my company..?

Have a pleasant weekend!
