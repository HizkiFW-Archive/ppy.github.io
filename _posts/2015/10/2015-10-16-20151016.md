Busy day today.

Finally published the stable40 release stream. A lot of work behind-the-scenes to make this happen.

Many people are still having performance issues with the new OpenGL release, so I haven't yet enabled automatic switching from stable to stable40. You may notice that your client is now on release stream Stable (Fallback) if you were previously on stable. This means you have not yet been migrated to stable40 (which is now known as just "Stable").

You are free to change between these two release streams as you wish. We will be maintaining both for the foreseeable future (at least six months) while we stabilise performance on compatibility on the newly released stable build.

Oh, and [a lot](https://osu.ppy.sh/p/changelog?v=b20151016.7&s=stable40) has changed between stable and stable40.

p.s. I didn't get around to posting the new OS X bundle, but if you download the one I posted yesterday and let osu! auto-update you should be good to go :).
