Hey guys! A bit late again with this post, but I had to figure out how to get your questions out of the twitter API and into my blog post. With that sorted, I now have a crapload of questions (thanks!) and can't decide where to stop answering them. So I'm just going to answer them all in rapid succession!

**@ppy Could you give us an update about osu!keyboards? Will we get more after the 1-month-store-sleep?** [–Skywockerz](http://twitter.com/Skywockerz/statuses/611167144185888769)

I'm still working with the manufacturers to get this happening. Takes time to scale up production. I always let you guys know on twitter when I make progress.

**@ppy Do you think reset Osu!coins in the game ?** [–Bourdel7](http://twitter.com/Bourdel7/statuses/611195034801709056)

Reset the balance that people obtains, or add them back? Probably yes to both, although I can't promise when this will happen (and the implementation will obviously be different!).

**@ppy Did you push the exclusive windowed mode rendering to cutting-edge yet?** [–Pannarii](http://twitter.com/Pannarii/statuses/611643715690602496)

Yes, it's live now! Go test it out.

**@ppy What's your favourite video game?** [–tonytonychoper6](http://twitter.com/tonytonychoper6/statuses/611761355624943616)

The game that has brought me the most laughter and enjoyment is probably Rainbox Six: Vegas 2. The game I have played the most, made friends (in contact to this day) and gained the most life experience from would be Ragnarok Online.

**@ppy Whats your favorite bit of technology used in osu or its supporting services?** [–KurtKartaltepe](http://twitter.com/KurtKartaltepe/statuses/611761475196030978)

[Slack](https://slack.com/). Can't live without it anymore.

**@ppy ok I have some question about you, do u have any plan to make other game? And do I have any plan about osu event?** [–orangekmc](http://twitter.com/orangekmc/statuses/611761868995039232)

**@ppy have you ever given much thought towards making any other games?** [–Ubercakez](http://twitter.com/Ubercakez/statuses/611812703980625920)

I would love to make another game, but I don't see that happening as long as I am running osu!. Instead, I'll probably try and use osu! as a platform to do other stuff I'd like to try.

**@ppy Idk what I do let me in resticted mode I sure I not break the rules I want to release restriction mode http://t.co/pw6pDPohyM** [–KronBrown](http://twitter.com/KronBrown/statuses/611762745315213312)

Contact [accounts](accounts@ppy.sh)

**@ppy How close are you to getting your personal plane** [–CommandoBanano](http://twitter.com/CommandoBanano/statuses/611764451050717184)

Already have 5. Seriously though, that was a joke. I doubt I'll ever make enough money to even consider such a useless purchase.

**@ppy Why did you choose to live in Japan? Were there any struggles?** [–ToraJikkyousha](http://twitter.com/ToraJikkyousha/statuses/611765447017537536)

This is probably worth a post of its own. I never really made a choice, though; I can move at any time. I still consider Australia home.

**@ppy I saw osu!Worldcup on Twitch, and I thought, \"That's good design!\". How do you make this broadcast in any way? http://t.co/wcDFki1J8I** [–6b_q](http://twitter.com/6b_q/statuses/611765630782472192)

It's a combination of awesome design work by [flyte](http://next.ppy.sh) and osu! client-side implementation by our skilled development team.

**@ppy do you have time for holidays and that kind of stuff?** [–FezZSky](http://twitter.com/FezZSky/statuses/611767165742661632)

If I wanted to, I could let osu! run itself. I choose to spend my time on osu!, rather than being forced to by the workload. So yes, I do take holidays (although I usually end up working through them because that's just the way I am).

**@ppy where is my pp** [–TerrilJanuary](http://twitter.com/TerrilJanuary/statuses/611769254598320132)

Over there!

**@ppy who's your favourite osu! player?** [–Muffinyay23](http://twitter.com/Muffinyay23/statuses/611770272140652544)

**@ppy your favorite osu! Player?** [–osuShatterz](http://twitter.com/osuShatterz/statuses/611797349250301952)

I don't like to play favourites.

**@ppy how many hours a day do you spend coding?** [–philipardeljan](http://twitter.com/philipardeljan/statuses/611770943308861440)

Not as many as I'd like. Really dependent on what else needs attending to, but between 0 and 24, usually.

**@ppy any hope for us to see mod v2 / osz v2 within a year?** [–TicClickie](http://twitter.com/TicClickie/statuses/611771493962399744)

Ugh. I really hope so..

**@ppy What will happen to tag coop and will it ever be a flawless gamemode?** [–_iDunno](http://twitter.com/_iDunno/statuses/611773034240831489)

Multiplayer really needs an overhaul.

**@ppy Do you think to do an official osu port for android?** [–sebaex](http://twitter.com/sebaex/statuses/611776002906263552)

For platform support, we're fixing OS X and linux first, but porting to iOS/android is next on the list after that.

**@ppy do you still look back and play EBA on the DS?** [–Plasmapie](http://twitter.com/Plasmapie/statuses/611776069629276160)

Nah, never owned that game. I played it once or twice but didn't like the song choice or style of the game. As for OTO, I haven't played it recently but sometimes I watch youtube videos and reminisce.

**@ppy What's your favorite kind of cake?** [–loup37](http://twitter.com/loup37/statuses/611776840441720832)

Sponge cakes with tasty icing. Cupcakes work too :D.

**@ppy  how works the pp system in calculate** [–Spielfehler96](http://twitter.com/Spielfehler96/statuses/611779556974927872)

There's information on that on [the wiki](https://osu.ppy.sh/wiki/Performance_Points).

**@ppy how old are you?** [–AdamAzraei_](http://twitter.com/AdamAzraei_/statuses/611779936974565377)

28.

**@ppy What parts of development do you look forward to and which parts you don't?** [–Bazzadwarf](http://twitter.com/Bazzadwarf/statuses/611780171352436736)

I attack everything head-on, but most enjoyable is when I get to write fresh code and learn new things. Most developers would probably agree.

**@ppy Would it ever be possible to have ranking displays in game update in real time?** [–UrnuryMegiken](http://twitter.com/UrnuryMegiken/statuses/611782642787192832)

Anything is possible.

**@ppy when osunext will be launched?** [–DonFapomar](http://twitter.com/DonFapomar/statuses/611784756523569152)

**@ppy Hey Peppy! Will the new osu! Website Design be released with the new osu! Client at the same time? And will it come this year or later?** [–mrkenfully](http://twitter.com/mrkenfully/statuses/611847449351725056)

**@ppy How's the osu!next work going? What can we expect to see on there in the future? (looks amazing so far btw)** [–Chippum_](http://twitter.com/Chippum_/statuses/611868709485944832)

As in replacing the old site? This won't happen until all functionality is implemented. But I mean, the forums are [already live](http://jizz.ppy.sh/forum/)! We will move parts over bit-by-bit.

**@ppy i've been in restricted mode for about 5 and a half months, what happens if I change my name?** [–IuffaI](http://twitter.com/IuffaI/statuses/611787509865951232)

Your restricted name will change.

**@ppy how often do you play osu! ?  do you like cats or dogs ?  is coding more of a passion to you or a hobby ?** [–NeilleJames](http://twitter.com/NeilleJames/statuses/611789515791806464)

As often as I need to. I like cats and dogs. Coding is life.

**@ppy What has been the hardest thing for you to code?** [–Quiesce7](http://twitter.com/Quiesce7/statuses/611792428677353473)

I have real trouble answering questions like this. If you mean what is the hardest *task*, then reviewing other developers' code (or fixing their bugs) has to be up there!

**@ppy What keeps you happy to continue growing the game?** [–osu_poseidon](http://twitter.com/osu_poseidon/statuses/611792724921090048)

Seeing people enjoy playing. Hearing stories of friendships created by osu!.

**@ppy What kind of items you are planning to sell in the future (like the tablet and keyboard)?** [–Repflez](http://twitter.com/Repflez/statuses/611792825546485760)

I want to make the ultimate rhythm game controller.

**@ppy What library/engine do you use for osu?** [–VirtuousNinja](http://twitter.com/VirtuousNinja/statuses/611794580846026752)

C#, OpenTK (cutting-edge)

**@ppy why is the Ctrl+R command a Hold command? (its a hard to accidentally press that button combination)** [–Holay63](http://twitter.com/Holay63/statuses/611795265796837376)

I think it feels nice. You can rebind it too, you know.

**@ppy Would you be interested in the idea of making videos showing you and flyte coding osu on your YouTube channel?** [–SnapFlash2](http://twitter.com/SnapFlash2/statuses/611795934058430464)

I still plan on streaming coding sessions as soon as I can make it happen.

**@ppy will you release a body pillow with you on it? I'm sure it would sell like crazy** [–Nickreh48](http://twitter.com/Nickreh48/statuses/611796916104331264)

No. Maybe a pippi one, though ;).

**@ppy How do you see osu! in five years? Do you play your own game right now?** [–Zeugmax_](http://twitter.com/Zeugmax_/statuses/611798198965956608)

I don't think ahead. I hope osu! is still being enjoyed by people as much as it is today.

**@ppy you should make mechanical keycaps with the osu! logo on them...** [–Nickreh48](http://twitter.com/Nickreh48/statuses/611798232960622592)

I should.

**@ppy will the current dev build pushed to stable when the design update happens or sooner?** [–Miterosan](http://twitter.com/Miterosan/statuses/611798437076561920)

Sooner. As soon as we fix 100% of OpenGL issues people are experiencing.

**@ppy will the pippy plushi be selled again?** [–Miterosan](http://twitter.com/Miterosan/statuses/611799467398987776)

If there's enough demand.

**@ppy do you have any other project than osu!? except puush of course** [–zxcvAstar](http://twitter.com/zxcvAstar/statuses/611799805073981440)

No. I have plenty of ideas but no time. osu! is my only focus.

**@ppy when can we espect to see coding live streams again?** [–Miterosan](http://twitter.com/Miterosan/statuses/611800693809283072)

**@ppy Will you stream in the future again? (You coding or related stuff) .  And do you have a time estimate for the osu!-teams update, ish?** [–xasuma](http://twitter.com/xasuma/statuses/611813766959898624)

I'll try and do at least one next week.

**@ppy can you give us an overview over the whole technical infrastructure which is powering osu?** [–fused_1](http://twitter.com/fused_1/statuses/611802231055249408)

Yes, I plan on doing this in a huge diagram in the near future. There's a lot to it.

**@ppy how's life in japan? can you speak japanese?** [–MintChoklate](http://twitter.com/MintChoklate/statuses/611802876558471170)

Life's good. Yes, I can. I'd argue that you should never live in a country if you aren't willing to speak the local language.

**@ppy is osu a hard game to code and do u earn enough money from it to buy jets?** [–iAzorex](http://twitter.com/iAzorex/statuses/611803689322283008)

It's not hard to code. I intentionally pay myself less than others working on the game because I could care less about money (I have enough to comfortably live, though).

**@ppy What's your favorite food?** [–ianBaak1](http://twitter.com/ianBaak1/statuses/611803692891774976)

Anything spicy.

**@ppy Hey peppy, do you listen to music when you're coding ? If yes, what genre ?** [–ScarySamurai](http://twitter.com/ScarySamurai/statuses/611804338072199168)

Dance/trance. Progressive streams usually. Classical or piano when my ears are tired.

**@ppy Has running osu become any easier to run than it used to be back in its humble beginnings?** [–enragementSteve](http://twitter.com/enragementSteve/statuses/611805157798637568)

Having the financial freedom to have others help out has definitely helped over the years. I am able to sleep properly at nights these days. That said, the challenges over the years have really shifted, so I'm not sure I would call it "easier", just "different".

**@ppy What's your favorite beatmap?** [–Cookiesack](http://twitter.com/Cookiesack/statuses/611806709875544064)

https://osu.ppy.sh/b/259&m=0

**@ppy You attended Dreamhack before? If so, how many times has it been?** [–xLolicore](http://twitter.com/xLolicore/statuses/611806813269299200)

I haven't, no.

**@ppy  Do you still plan on reworking the charts system as talked about when ppv2 was in development?** [–soulgdps](http://twitter.com/soulgdps/statuses/611815508254457856)

Yeah. There's a start to it in the osu! client on cutting-edge. Just finding the time and focus..

**@ppy Hey me and a few friends are planning a trip to japan soon, Real short Do & Don't list? #QandA** [–Fnrblackbird](http://twitter.com/Fnrblackbird/statuses/611819131042553856)

Do get a JR pass. Do use it as much as you can (it's amazing value). Explore both the cities and the rural areas.

**@ppy How are you doing?** [–ben_gmoney](http://twitter.com/ben_gmoney/statuses/611819925238198272)

Woke up at 3am to a really nice cool breeze. Doing just fine :).

**@ppy unban reimu xd! just kidding. Do you follow the top osu players and pay attention to great scores on maps? Like _Index, HDHR, Hvick etc** [–JKlan217](http://twitter.com/JKlan217/statuses/611821430049632256)

I try to, but it's not one of my focuses in life.

**@ppy Is the skin creation will be much diferent than before ? There will be a program/software to help ?** [–Xialyz](http://twitter.com/Xialyz/statuses/611821633431597056)

In-game drag-drop editor is planned.

**@ppy How does it feel when people prefer to discuss on anonymous platform than official osu forums? Do you think that's okay?** [–Perazlt](http://twitter.com/Perazlt/statuses/611823614388772864)

Each to their own.

**@ppy Will you ever play your own game competitively?** [–ShavitY](http://twitter.com/ShavitY/statuses/611829122743013377)

Never. I'd sooner play LoL professionally ;).

**@ppy Now that osu! is getting much more popular, do you have a plan in case big artists attack you with their copyrights?** [–Lekamil_](http://twitter.com/Lekamil_/statuses/611830247823147008)

Comply. Although I always follow-up with artists to see if they want to negotiate in some other way. While I accept copyright law, I don't believe taking down content is in anyones interest, so I love working out alternatives. Got some stuff in the pipes of this nature.

**@ppy Is there still any chance that osu! will be open sourced? There hasn't been news about it for quite some time now.** [–mario185](http://twitter.com/mario185/statuses/611831934214348800)

Everything we are working on right now is in that direction. Still quite a bit of clean-up to be done before it can happen, but it will.

**@ppy hey mate, any plans for iPhone 6 skins soon?** [–zeldavgc](http://twitter.com/zeldavgc/statuses/611838993466945536)

As soon as stickermule offer them. Or we find another provider.

**@ppy how much of the original 2007 osu! code remains today?** [–minusGN](http://twitter.com/minusGN/statuses/611839855199436801)

More than should (as in, more than zero), but consistently decreasing.

**@ppy I love osu!, thank you and the team for creating and maintaining this game. Have a nice day.** [–Longitivityy](http://twitter.com/Longitivityy/statuses/611844335835852800)

You're welcome!

**@ppy When will FL give more pp ?** [–Oreemo_osu](http://twitter.com/Oreemo_osu/statuses/611846638349459456)

Ask Tom.

**@ppy with the new name-change how is reverting to original name? Like you changed before then changed again now, if you want to revert back?** [–Taboki_Tabby](http://twitter.com/Taboki_Tabby/statuses/611848803830890496)

Contact support and we will help you out.

**@ppy That being said, I did get an error after checkout that something broke (d0e0bc9db62e457cbb80072ea5cf1017). But it still worked fine.** [–poke](http://twitter.com/poke/statuses/611854009444470784)

**@ppy How good are you at osu! ?** [–stupidsalad](http://twitter.com/stupidsalad/statuses/611854471728119809)

Pretty bad.

**@ppy How did you come up with the idea of this game? (I mean osu!)** [–bbj0920](http://twitter.com/bbj0920/statuses/611856908836691968)

By playing a certain NDS game called Osu! Tatakae! Ouendan! and wanting to make it more customisable.

**@ppy as a big hidden fan I'd love to know: Can we expect a way to make sliders completely transparent anytime soon?** [–8MeMyselfAndI8](http://twitter.com/8MeMyselfAndI8/statuses/611859192702439428)

Likely with the new graphics/UI, yes.

**@ppy Would you ever put in a mod for left handed players that flips maps horizontally?** [–TomHolm66179907](http://twitter.com/TomHolm66179907/statuses/611860122730655744)

Considering, but not sure if ranked.

**@ppy what do you think a about the osu competitive scene?** [–Ornsteins_Gate](http://twitter.com/Ornsteins_Gate/statuses/611861936649699328)

I'd like to improve it with a proper multiplayer ranking system. Something less static than overall pp. I want to see more dynamic changes in the rankings each week.

**@ppy Is Touhosu still planned as a new gamemode? The idea of Touhou crossed with Osu! sounds incredebly cool ^^!** [–NoI3odyLP](http://twitter.com/NoI3odyLP/statuses/611864794833006592)

Yes.

**@ppy How about the progress of making osu! run in other platforms like linux and mac OS? What was the major challenges on this?** [–italobechepeche](http://twitter.com/italobechepeche/statuses/611865431872249856)

Making huge forward progress on this.

**@ppy When you originally started Osu compared to today, was there anything in the code that made you go \"no way\" and removed it immediately?** [–LinkuTV](http://twitter.com/LinkuTV/statuses/611873235114819584)

Basically everything.

**@ppy Do you consider yourself a weaboo?** [–dickduncan1](http://twitter.com/dickduncan1/statuses/611876712775815168)

No.

**@ppy some people think that QAT was a bad idea, and it will disappear in the future. What do you think about that?** [–EruJazz](http://twitter.com/EruJazz/statuses/611877181317361664)

I can't really make a call, but we are always looking to improve the way things work. If a better solution presents itself, maybe.

**@ppy what is that one thing in your life that you regret the most?** [–mkHeinzen](http://twitter.com/mkHeinzen/statuses/611880935345164288)

I have no regrets.. except being too shy to approach girls in high school / university.

**@ppy What would happen if the pp algorithm were to be leaked? Also, which part of coding osu! has given you the most grief over the years?** [–riffraff11235](http://twitter.com/riffraff11235/statuses/611894566493368320)

It will also be open-sourced soon.

**@ppy what there a Q&A ??** [–MrBim_](http://twitter.com/MrBim_/statuses/611882812078100480)

There was.

Have a good weekend peoples.
