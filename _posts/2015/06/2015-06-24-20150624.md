Another mini-update!

- Continued work on restructuring the draw hierarchy. In the process, cleaned up a lot of remaining XNA framework. We're slowly getting to the point the remnants can completely be removed, which is an exciting prospect!

- Made a new branch testing out visual studio [shared projects](http://developer.xamarin.com/guides/cross-platform/application_fundamentals/shared_projects/). This is a necessity for moving cross-platform support forward, as each platform will need to have a different base set of compatibility code, but share the majority of the osu! code-base. Manually updating .csproj files each time a new code file is added for each platform would be a pain. Ends up looking something like [this](http://puu.sh/iBlki/a4d7aedaea.png) (note the different icon for the shared "osu!" project).

- Saw osu! running under MonoMac for the first time! This is osu! running on OS X without the wine layer, and packaged into a distributable and lean ~200mb .app bundle. Pretty exciting news here for OS X users. We still have a bit of a way to go to get things ready to test publicly, but it's another step forward in the right direction.

- Spent some time discussing how to make the new [forums](http://jizz.ppy.sh/forum/) feel better when scrolling upwards in a long thread (and triggering the dynamic infini-loading logic). I think we've come up with a solution that should feel quite a lot nicer than what you've seen so far.

And that's all for today. I hope to stream some coding Thursday or Friday all going well, so keep a [watch out](http://twitch.tv/ppy) for that!
