Another day dedicated to fixing performance regressions on stable40. Spent quite a few hours debugging with users, but after making little progress began to work on more visibility of diagnostic information when a stutter frame is encountered.

Since quite a few builds ago, the Cutting-Edge stream has had a `performance.log` file (along with many other varieties of logs found in the new "Logs" folder â€“ how appropriate!). As of the latest release, each time a dropped frame is detected (indicated by a little square next to the FPS counter), a decent amount of statistics will be dumped to this file.

The FPS meter is quite liberal with what it considers dropped frames, so this file may get a bit busy over time. Fortunately, the format is quite easy to process and is fully timestamped.

If you are one of those people still encountering stuttering frame-rates on the new releases, now more than ever before can you give us what we need to help solve your problems. Note that this implementation isn't complete yet; more statistics will be added over the coming days.

We are also building up a fairly comprehensive knowledge base of what hardware, software and drivers can possibly cause issues with osu!. Going forward, I hope to have osu! detect apps running which can negatively impact performance and alert the user.

While we have some very helpful people on public slack helping with testing (special thanks to [DPL](https://osu.ppy.sh/u/DPL) for his time), we could always do with more! Get on over and watch or participate!
