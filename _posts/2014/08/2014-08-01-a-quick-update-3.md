What has happened in the last two months?

* Had an amazing time at Japan Expo, meeting a huge number of French players and hopefully introducing as many new ones!
* Gave an updated talk about the history of osu!, along with Q&A and live play in dual language (French and English). Watch it [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAjH4DASNZU)!
* I answered even more questions on [episode 8 of osu!talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vdW5uZutU). Thanks to ztrot for having me on the show!
* I received some open source [mini-keyboard controllers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOLnWUeRovw) for osu! from some chinese users. You can already [make them yourself](http://noodlefighter.tk/Osu_Keyboard.html), but I also hope at some point we can offer these for sale at a low price.
* osu! saw more development activity over the last month from people who aren't me than ever before. This is very exciting to see, and makes me a little more confident that the osu! codebase isn't in as bad a state as I perceive it to be!
* Progress is being made towards an open source osu!. Piece by piece I am separating git repositories of various components so they can be released separately from each other as required.
* We hit 200k likes on [facebook](http://facebook.com/osugame). Hooray!
* I completely rehauled the banning system behind the scenes to allow for more automation, as it was getting out-of-hand for us to handle manually. The results are [promisingly good](https://osu.ppy.sh/p/bans) (or bad, in a sad way).
* Work continues on a new update/release system which will allow for multiple release streams to exist. Users will be able to switch between stable/beta/cutting-edge. This will also allow for mgiration to dotnet40 while keeping a compatibility branch on dotnet20 while people migrate across.
* A [new game intro](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HuFQkoL-0NM) is in the works, including a long-overdue theme song. You may also notice that sound effects have been improved. This is all already live on test build but won't be available on public for a while.
* Download and update mirrors are centrally managed and traffic is automatically shifted as servers become available/unavailable. DNS changes are also automated via the Cloudflare API when server issues are detected, reducing downtime to only a couple of minutes.
* I have been a bit busy with boring stuff like restructuring the way osu! is run as a business to make sure I can keep up with the ever-increasing workload. Trying to get more hands on board to get new features out to you guys faster than ever.
* Huge kudos to Tom94 for taking my lead and rehaulling most of the song select code. The result is a more performant and slicker song select screen than ever before. And it's only going to get better from here!
* My sister made me an [osu! stamp](http://puu.sh/adAF7/07da5cdc20.jpg)!
* Someone used my design documents to [make their own version](https://osu.ppy.sh/forum/p/3176965) of the osu!arcade unit!
* We are running another [fanart contest](https://osu.ppy.sh/news/93268273058) aiming to create a bunch of stickers, which may be used around the place in the future (both digitally and physically)!
* Someone made a [programming problem](http://community.topcoder.com/stat?c=problem_statement&pm=12807&rd=15856) based on CtB.
* People [continue to be dishonest](http://puu.sh/axbkB/66e0db3d02.png) and unbelievably [abusive](http://puu.sh/9Jwbj/06af04c031.png).
