In our efforts to release the osu! client as open source, we still have a lot of clean-up and refactoring that needs to be done. I've been putting in as much of my own time as possible to make this happen, but things are still a bit slower than I'm hoping for.

Last meeting I made the decision to fork what is known as "lazer" into a new git repository. The purpose of this would be to remove all history, confidential code, deprecated systems etc. and provide a new starting point for the open source future.

While we are not ready to make the open source project available, I am now seeking developers who are interested in helping out before this happens. Because this is an effort to *increase* efficiency, applicant criteria are very strict, so make sure to read the carefully before applying:

- Agree to work under a non-open source licence (all contributions would be copyright ppy Pty Ltd).
- Have a confident knowledge of c# 6.0 and be able to prove it with github projects.
- Have a confident knowledge of tree-based rendering.
- Willing to work on specific areas we require you to focus on.
- Be an amicable person.
- Happy to work without rewards (though as always, I will try to reward significant contributions at rates beyond expectations).
- Have enough free time over the next few months to contribute at a decent rate.

If interested, contact using a plain text email at lazer@ppy.sh. Include a link to your github profile and any reasons you want to be included on this project. I will give precedence to people who I am familiar with.

Don't necessarily expect a reply; I'll only reply to those people who we decide are good fits for the team. Also keep in mind that we are not ready to accept contributors so replying may take a week or two.

If you apply but miss out, please don't be disheartened! This is a very targeted team only to help us prepare osu! for mainstream contributions. You will have your chance soon :).
