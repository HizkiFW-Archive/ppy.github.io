A lot of people have requested higher resolution copies of my photography over the months since I started publishing it to [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/__ppy/). I've finally compiled all the uploads so far as a wallpaper pack.

Resolutions I'm supporting this time around are:

- Desktop 1920x1200 (16:10)
- Desktop WQHD 2560x1600 (16:10)

- Mobile 640x1136 (9:16)

I understand some of you may use different aspect ratios, but these should adapt quite well. For people running 16:9 on PC, set to "Fit" for the best result.

As an experiment, I'm hosting this [on GitHub](https://github.com/peppy/wallpapers). If you're a savvy user, feel free to clone (and star) the repository and pull new updates via git. If not, you can download the release from [here](https://github.com/peppy/wallpapers/releases).

As for the lack of dev posts for me, there's a few reasons.

- I've been busy.
- The meeting notes and osu!weekly posts are taking a lot of my content away from me (this isn't a bad thing either).
- I've been busy.

Enjoy :). Tweet me a photo of your setup if you end up using one of these!

Update: Added WQHD resolution as per requests.
