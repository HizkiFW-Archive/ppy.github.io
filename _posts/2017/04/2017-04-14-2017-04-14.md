Bringing you the latest in osu! development

A slightly shorter post today as I have been busy with non-lazer tasks and drinking (it's a friday after all!).

## New HUD layout

While the visual finish pass is not complete yet, this build completed movement of HUD elements to roughly their final locations. Do keep in mind this will be user customisable, before you start complaining about change. The largest change here is that the combo is now at the top of the screen in a more centered display.

The main reason to get this in even without polish applied was to also allow for...

## Song progress display

<div style="width: 100%; height: 0px; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.250%;"><iframe src="//streamable.com/s/52yju/pfjtfl" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen scrolling="no" style="width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;"></iframe><script async src="//v.embedcdn.com/v1/embed.js"></script></div>

Not only tracking the current position in the song, this control will also show map density (may be configurable as to what it shows in the future) and also has a draggable seeker, which will be hooked up to replay control in the near future. This control is also lacking visual finish, but I am currently pushing to get these components live in a working state then iterate on the design to bring it up to scratch with my own expectations.

## New release with all the above (and changes from yesterday)

2017.415.0 is now available from [github releases](https://github.com/ppy/osu/releases/tag/v2017.415.0) (or via auto-update if you already have lazer installed)!
