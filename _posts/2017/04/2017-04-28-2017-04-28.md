## Song select performance

I spent some time today addressing the stuttering performance at song select. Being the centre of osu!, song select is important to get right. There are a lot of piece working together, so it's essential to get the threading and [debouncing](http://www.labbookpages.co.uk/electronics/debounce.html) logic correct from the get-go.

The [changes I worked on today](https://github.com/ppy/osu/pull/684) improve performance when quickly selecting multiple beatmaps (especially when using the arrow keys), as well as begin cleaning up the event flow of panel selection which was quite convoluted until now.

## Improved lead-in time support

There were still a few remaining issues with lead-in time which have now [been resolved](https://github.com/ppy/osu/pull/681). As of the next release all maps with any amount of lead-in should be playable, finally!

## Other things

- Began some work on improving memory management of gRAM via [memory pressure](https://github.com/ppy/osu-framework/pull/673).
- Fixed audio samples stopping playing when [too many channels](https://github.com/ppy/osu-framework/pull/672/commits/a9e4979db93549716d38e7b19bca4797531328bc) are played in a short period.
- Improved overall performance by ~10% when many drawables are [being removed on a regular basis](https://github.com/ppy/osu-framework/pull/672/commits/cf56470415688f6f5d3722cdbe68b2258b6f89c6).

## No release today!

Waiting to get a few more pull requests merged before pushing out the next build.

Oh and you may have noticed I skipped a day's blog yesterday. While I will try and keep up daily blogs, I am not holding myself to it. I regularly need to take breaks from coding to catch up on email, accounting, support, etc. so keep that in mind if you don't hear from me for a period of time :).
