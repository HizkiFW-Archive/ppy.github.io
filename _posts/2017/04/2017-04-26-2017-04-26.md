## Continued work on clocks and seeking support

Here's a very raw preview of seeking support utilising speed changes. Rewind support isn't completely implemented, but can be generally fixed with a [few lines of change](https://streamable.com/f2sib) (though the correct solution will take a bit more thinking, as this was achieved by disabling some game-wide optimisations).

<div style="width: 100%; height: 0px; position: relative; padding-bottom: 67.004%;"><iframe src="https://streamable.com/s/wqmfm/azezrw" frameborder="0" width="100%" height="100%" allowfullscreen style="width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;"></iframe></div>

The end goal is to allow seeking in both directions with completely accurate scoring and playback. I actually already achieved this on [lazer-transitional](https://blog.ppy.sh/post/146687255823/a-long-overdue-update) in a distant past and am using similar techniques to reimplement this on lazer, so it's quite familiar (yet still daunting) territory!

## Added support for lead-in time

Makes a lot of maps playable that previously weren't. Haven't extensively tested this yet, and it will likely receive further revisions over the next few days.

## Other things

- osu!taiko drumroll conversion has received some minor fixes [#663](https://github.com/ppy/osu/pull/663).
- ..as have swells (spinner converts) [#676](https://github.com/ppy/osu/pull/676).
- My changes from yesterday have been merged (improving replay playback accuracy) [#672](https://github.com/ppy/osu/pull/672) & [#667](https://github.com/ppy/osu-framework/pull/667).

## New release available

2017.426.0 is now available from [github releases](https://github.com/ppy/osu/releases/tag/v2017.426.0) (or via auto-update if you already have lazer installed)! Contains everything above.
