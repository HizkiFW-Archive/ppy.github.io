Coming at 'ya with some well-overdue updates.

# osu!lazer

## Import from osu-stable!

Finally, you can bring over your existing beatmap collection to lazer in one simple click... with a few caveats

- We haven't done extensive testing on compatibility of older beatmaps, so some may not be loaded correctly.
- Importing will be a bit slow, mainly due to the concurrent disk operation required to copy all the data across.
- Even after import, song select will struggle to load initially with a large number of maps. This will of course be optimised in the future.

If you have a lot of maps, I'd highly recommend letting it import some number of maps and then cancelling the task (via the notifications overlay).

## osu!catch basics!

Parsing of basic fruits and some wonky display logic. This isn't in a truly playable state yet, but a lot of the underlying framework has been complete. Working closely with smoogipoo, we have made it possible for taiko, mania and catch to share a great portion of their code (they all display objects in a scrolling fashion)!

## Bindings are stored!

The key binding framework is now in place, with global and per-ruleset support. While there is no UI yet, they are already persisting in the database, which specific support for different handling in different rulesets.

A new build is up as of yesterday, so go check out the [full release notes](https://github.com/ppy/osu/releases/tag/v2017.802.0) to see what's new!
