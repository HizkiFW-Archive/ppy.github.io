Plowing forward with lazer progress, amongst other things.

# 10th anniversary packs available!

During Anime Expo, we were gleefully handing out over 2,000 sticker/postcard/pin sets as part of our presence. We saved a small number for those who couldn't make it but want to get a share of the amazing designs that were featured. You can now pick one up for around $6 including shipping (we're basically selling at no profit) [from the store](https://osu.ppy.sh/store/product/225), while stocks last!

# osu!lazer

I spent a lot of this week fixing bugs and tidying up important paths in the codebase. The main focus was handling of the currently loaded beatmap, covering state changes as selections are made at song select, in the music controller (via the playlist) and what happens when there are no available beatmaps due to a filter or the user deleting all their maps.

While this took quite a bit of time, I think it's safe to say it was worth it. Not only has performance been improved, but a lot of janky transitions and behaviours have been resolved.

A new build is up today, so go check out the [full release notes](https://github.com/ppy/osu/releases/tag/v2017.721.0) to see what's new!
