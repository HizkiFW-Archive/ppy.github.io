Hello! Approaching the one month mark since last post, so let's handle this a bit differently!

First of all, I'm going to focus less on detailed changes to lazer in blog posts and go for a more overall view of osu!. There's more going on than just lazer and I want to cover this too. I've also automated changelog generation for the lazer builds directly, so posting here would be duplicating a lot of what is already posted against the builds.

That said, you can now check out [v2017.709.0](https://github.com/ppy/osu/releases/tag/v2017.616.0), with an insane number of additions, improvements and bug fixes.



# Try it yourself

2017.616.0 is now available from [github releases](https://github.com/ppy/osu/releases/tag/v2017.616.0) (or via auto-update if you already have lazer installed)! Keep in mind that this is still very much an alpha release. We do not offer support for it just yet!
