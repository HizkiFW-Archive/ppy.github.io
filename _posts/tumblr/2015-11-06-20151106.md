Pushed a few further fixes to cutting-edge for stuttering. Still tracking down some of the more common causes (a bit hard to pinpoint them!).
Adjusted the new combined Unlimited FPS setting to be more friendly to users who want to stay in unlimited fps throughout gameplay. Now maintains unlimited throughout breaks and intro time (and also for replays).
Busy with OWC preparations. Hopefully we’ll have something to surprise you guys with tomorrow! Hope you guys are hyped for the tournament; it’s gonna be the biggest ever!
Replaced my key caps recently, so enjoy some photos of my custom layout as a consolation for the short update post!
