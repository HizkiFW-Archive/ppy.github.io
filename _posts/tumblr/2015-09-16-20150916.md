Fixed BSS connectivity issues and started working with users who are encountering window handle overflows to solve that one. To me, this is the only remaining blocker for getting out the new stable40 build. Caught up on accounting and email. Fixed a few other bugs that I came across while testing the above issues (BSS should be more reliable than ever as a result).

Working through some legal issues at the moment which are stealing away my time (namely Oregon State University not wanting me to file a trademark for osu!). I can see this one taking a long time to resolve, but Iâ€™m willing to ride it out and see how things go.

Days like this I wish I had more interesting stuff going on to share with you, but alas.
