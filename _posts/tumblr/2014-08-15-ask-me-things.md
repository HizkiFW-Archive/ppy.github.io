I have an aversion to ask.fm, but I do know a lot of people out there have a lot of things they would like to ask. I plan on doing an AMA on reddit some day, but until then I’d like to leave this post here to gather questions in the comments which people would like answers to. I will post follow-up entries here answering the top-voted questions (or any I feel deserve an answer).

You’re welcome to ask any questions with no scope limits.

I will not answer questions that are stupid.
I will not answer questions from anonymous or invalid email addresses.
