Finally got the osu!stream update live, and surprisingly, it’s running perfectly!
Battling with my PC, which refuses to run cygwin or msys based applications since the last windows insider updater. May require a format back to stable windows 10 at this rate :(.
Working towards offering a recovery path for users which switch to CE (or stable40, once we release it) but crash at startup. osu! should now automatically repair itself back to the old stable stream.
This happened yesterday, but I changed the way qualified maps are rate-limited such that there is no longer a daily limit of maps that can be qualified, but rather a limit of maps which are switched to ranked. This should take the stress off Beatmap Nominators trying all day to get their chance at a qualified slot.
Working on OWC preparations in the background and while I can’t reveal too much just yet, we have a few awesome changes in store this year for both players and spectators!
