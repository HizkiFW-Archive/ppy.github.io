What has happened in the last two months?

Had an amazing time at Japan Expo, meeting a huge number of French players and hopefully introducing as many new ones!
Gave an updated talk about the history of osu!, along with Q&A and live play in dual language (French and English). Watch it here!
I answered even more questions on episode 8 of osu!talk. Thanks to ztrot for having me on the show!
I received some open source mini-keyboard controllers for osu! from some chinese users. You can already make them yourself, but I also hope at some point we can offer these for sale at a low price.
osu! saw more development activity over the last month from people who aren’t me than ever before. This is very exciting to see, and makes me a little more confident that the osu! codebase isn’t in as bad a state as I perceive it to be!
Progress is being made towards an open source osu!. Piece by piece I am separating git repositories of various components so they can be released separately from each other as required.
We hit 200k likes on facebook. Hooray!
I completely rehauled the banning system behind the scenes to allow for more automation, as it was getting out-of-hand for us to handle manually. The results are promisingly good (or bad, in a sad way).
Work continues on a new update/release system which will allow for multiple release streams to exist. Users will be able to switch between stable/beta/cutting-edge. This will also allow for mgiration to dotnet40 while keeping a compatibility branch on dotnet20 while people migrate across.
A new game intro is in the works, including a long-overdue theme song. You may also notice that sound effects have been improved. This is all already live on test build but won’t be available on public for a while.
Download and update mirrors are centrally managed and traffic is automatically shifted as servers become available/unavailable. DNS changes are also automated via the Cloudflare API when server issues are detected, reducing downtime to only a couple of minutes.
I have been a bit busy with boring stuff like restructuring the way osu! is run as a business to make sure I can keep up with the ever-increasing workload. Trying to get more hands on board to get new features out to you guys faster than ever.
Huge kudos to Tom94 for taking my lead and rehaulling most of the song select code. The result is a more performant and slicker song select screen than ever before. And it’s only going to get better from here!
My sister made me an osu! stamp!
Someone used my design documents to make their own version of the osu!arcade unit!
We are running another fanart contest aiming to create a bunch of stickers, which may be used around the place in the future (both digitally and physically)!
Someone made a programming problem based on CtB.
People continue to be dishonest and unbelievably abusive.
I’m sure I’ve missed quite a bit here, but until next time. Follow me on twitter for more regular updates!
