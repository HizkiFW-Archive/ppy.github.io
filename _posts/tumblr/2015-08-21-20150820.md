Was in bed with a fever yesterday. All the muscles in my body were in pain and I honestly didnâ€™t get much done. Quite rare for me, but these things happen!

Caught up today late into the night:

Finally seem to have figured out the cause of our master DB instance hitting a performance wall! The culprit is looking to be related to the sheer number of connections we are servicing per second (in excess of 800 at peak). Have a few potential solutions which I started preparing for testing today. More to come after I actually test them.
Finally getting closer than ever to the next public release (like, an actual one). A few minor bugs left to fix, but thanks to some amazing optimisation effort by Tom94 things are running buttery smooooth.
Finally sourced some osu!tablet pens! Should have them stocked on the osu!store for people wanting a spare or replacement after throwing their pens ON THE GROUND. Pricing should be much more reasonable than Amazon (hoping for less than $15 including shipping).
It is now more than ever that we need your feedback on cutting-edge! Report on slack, but make sure to also post in the cutting-edge thread so your feedback is not missed!
