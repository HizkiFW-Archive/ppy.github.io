I’m very aware that I haven’t been posting much here. It mainly boils down to the fact that as long as I have things to do that are directly contributing value to osu!, I avoid spending my time writing. I have a few posts written up in a semi-complete state, but haven’t had a chance to finalise them yet. Don’t go away; I will make things happen eventually.

So what has happened over the last four months?

I’ve been working on expanding the osu! team. If you think you have what it takes (highly motivated, ambitious, fast-learning) then get in touch.
Second batch of tablets arrived this week, and I have been busy busy writing up a web store from scratch to handle the sales. Coming this weekend at latest.
Moved the new osu! website to run completely on hhvm. Have been sinking a lot of time into this to ensure it is a strong framework ready to handle rapid expansion in the future.
Working on getting many more products to the coming osu!store, including plushies, stickers, better quality t-shirts and more!
Setup continuous integration for osu! client builds. I can now create new test/public builds without having a dev environment on my local PC, which is pretty amazing.
Moved all storage to Amazon S3. Any of osu!’s infrastructure can now be deployed within a few minutes without having to worry about locally stored content. This is pretty huge!
Refreshed the server which bancho runs on to allow for future expansion.
Further automated server monitoring and response to better handle issues that previously required manual intervention.
For those wondering about osu!stream (see my last post), I haven’t been able to post an update as the issues are still on-going and I don’t believe it is in my interest to release details until I reach some kind of resolution. Apologies to those who have been waiting to hear more.

I have been pretty busy in real-life, travelling back to Australia land to attend (and handle videography) for a wedding, renewing visas and bringing the books up-to-date to file my tax return. Things should be a bit calmer over the next six months, so expect more soon.

I’ll try and throw some update posts like this to keep you guys in the loop of what I am up to.
