Today I attended and presented at a local game development showcase event run by letsmakegames.org – “Show us your Bits”. I decided to focus on the process involved with porting osu! to the mobile platform, and the technical decisions and optimisations that consumed a large chunk of the development time.
I also had the chance to talk with more local game developers than I knew existed, and give some eager people a shot at osu!stream :).
The event was recorded so there will likely be a recording of my presentation (and others) available in the future, at which point I’ll make sure I link it.  For the time being I’m going to dump my presentation’s slides here for public consumption. They may not completely stand-alone, but will give an idea of the stuff I covered. If you are interested in anything in particular, leave a comment and I can go into more detail!

Note that due to the filesize, videos are not included in this web-viewable copy.
