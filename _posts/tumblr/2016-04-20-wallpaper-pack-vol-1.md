A lot of people have requested higher resolution copies of my photography over the months since I started publishing it to instagram. I’ve finally compiled all the uploads so far as a wallpaper pack.

Resolutions I’m supporting this time around are:

Desktop 1920x1200 (16:10)
Desktop WQHD 2560x1600 (16:10)


Mobile 640x1136 (9:16)


I understand some of you may use different aspect ratios, but these should adapt quite well. For people running 16:9 on PC, set to “Fit” for the best result.

As an experiment, I’m hosting this on GitHub. If you’re a savvy user, feel free to clone (and star) the repository and pull new updates via git. If not, you can download the release from here.

As for the lack of dev posts for me, there’s a few reasons.

I’ve been busy.
The meeting notes and osu!weekly posts are taking a lot of my content away from me (this isn’t a bad thing either).
I’ve been busy.
Enjoy :). Tweet me a photo of your setup if you end up using one of these!

Update: Added WQHD resolution as per requests.
