Between continued work on fixing the remaining issues with the new draw hierachy and working through behind-the-scenes maintenance tasks, I find myself pretty tired by the end of a day. Then I realise I haven’t written a blog post yet!

I guess I’ll share with you what I got done today in a very raw fashion for a change! Enjoy some git logs :).



Hope everyone is having a productive start to the week. Here’s my current background music of choice: some amazing new age piano I came across while working from a cafe. Been enjoying some quieter music recently; I may have worn my ears out overdosing on Zedd over the last couple of months ^^;.
