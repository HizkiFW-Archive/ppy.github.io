Some updates:

I was hoping to do a public release today (Monday), but there are still some hard crashes I’d like to be able to handle better before seeding it out to more users.
One user reported disk IO being the cause for dropped frames. As a result, we changed the way audio tracks are buffered to ensure there is no disk IO occurring during active playing.
Spent some time today removing all GDI text rendering during active playing. This may have been a cause for random spikes for some users, so I’m excited to see whether it helps alleviate issues or not. Please don’t comment on the new font; it will see improvements before going public.
Cutting edge builds are more optimised than ever, so if you’re not already using them, now is the time to try it out.

Also, a thanks to everyone who contributed to osu-web over the weekend. We’re still catching up, but will see to your pull requests as soon as possible (and rewarding of bounty where applicable!).

…How is it September already?
