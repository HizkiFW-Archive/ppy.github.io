We’ve been doing a lot of work behind the scenes on the framework osu! runs on (the lazer project). Today I took a step back to test a week of intense coding changes with smoogipooo to see how things feel and work.

I made a little game which took 5 hours and 375 lines of code to write. Would have been 2 or 3 hours if I didn’t find some bugs along the way with the framework (this was my intention, so I am very happy).



Download here (30mb because it contains osu! resources, sorry)

Controls:

W to move up
S to move down
D to boost
tab to autoplay
I’ll release the full source for this in the near future. And yes, this will likely appear as a game mode for osu! in the future (maybe a just-for-fun one like target practice :).

We are making great progress here. Big cogs are turning!

Enjoy your weekend!
