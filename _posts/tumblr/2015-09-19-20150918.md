osu!tablet replacement pens are now available from the store. I priced these at the absolute lowest price possible.
nono keyboards are still a bit further away.
Working on improvements to the support / ban appeal process. Nothing to announce yet, but this is an area I wish to see improvement in.
Still not confident enough to release the new stable. Not even sure what the cause of the remaining issues are (really sucks trying to fix things you canâ€™t reproduce yourself).
Switched from pingdom to statuscake. Not looking back. The osu! status page has changed slightly as a result.
Almost got back to inbox zero. Is my goal for this weekend!
