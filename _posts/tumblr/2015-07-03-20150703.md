Thanks to everyone for their questions on twitter today; some fun ones in there! I will be going through them tomorrow over some drinks and posting tomorrow evening (my time), but I don’t come empty-handed! Here’s one amusing example of how the new hierachical sprite system can be used to achieve previously impossible results.



Note that while rotating and scaling excessively, the main menu still performs (and handles input) how it should. Pretty fun stuff! Now we are officially on-par with osu!stream flexibility, as I explained yesterday.

Hope you’ve already checked out flyte’s latest, with a reveal of the new hitcircle design.

Have a great Friday. More at you tomorrow!
