Spent today going through pull requests, fixing CE bugs, catching up on emails and customer support (sorry to those of you that have had lingering issues with payments… they should all be resolved now!) all while pondering over whether to update to iOS 9 and lose jailbreak.

Had a 28 minute downtime due to the master DB server’s hypervisor host needing a reboot. Ah well, these things happen. I took the opportunity to share exactly what it sounds like for me when servers die. Try and sleep through that ;).
