Hope you are all having a productive and energetic start to your weeks.

Another quick Monday update, as I spent most of today catching up on completely uninteresting tasks that I will spare you the details of. This week will hopefully bring some exciting changes to the table which have taken a while to get ready for public consumption.

I can say that we may have made a breakthrough in graphics compatibility for the next osu! release (currently what you see on cutting-edge). While we are testing internally, the whole team is hopeful that this will bring us as close as we are going to get to 100% compatibility.

More to come on that soon, by means of a first-time guest post :).
