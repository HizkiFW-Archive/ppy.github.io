Today I spent almost the whole day debugging my new HTTP code to figure why the post body data is not sent when the request is over a certain size. I still have no idea why it isn’t working. Some days you just try everything but it’s not enough. If anyone feels like looking through my code, be my guest (find the problem before I do and I’ll be eternally grateful).

In strangely related news, I also began introducing bounties to the osu!web project. This means that if you are willing to help us out by completing feature requests (or fixing bugs, as it may be) I will compensate you for your time. If this sounds interesting to you, check out the bounty rewards list, and check the osu!web’s issues page for current available tasks. Look for the bounty keyword, specifically :).

Any questions? Ask here in the comments and I’ll do my best to clarify things.
