Gonna be a super-quick post today since I completely wore myself out on code.



Big numbers, big changes. All in a very positive direction.

Itâ€™s rare I find such an opportunity to focus on code like I did today. I will inevitably regret it tomorrow, when I start playing the catch-up game with the many shitstorms that await me in my inbox.

Best of weekends to you all!
