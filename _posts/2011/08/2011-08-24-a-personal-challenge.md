<p>Following a <a href="http://puu.sh/4IA3">twitter conversation</a> with a <a href="http://www.tim-oliver.com/">good friend</a> of mine, I have decided to attempt one-blog-a-day until I run out of interesting things to post about.</p>&#13;
<p>My aim is to post on topics that can't fit in a tweet, while not impeding on my schedule to the point where I can't make a daily post. As with all blogging experiments, I'm not sure how long this will last, but you can't do more than start positively and hope for the best.</p>&#13;
<p>I do have a good deal of things to post about saved up over the years, but not recorded anywhere, so this will be an impulsive process mostly focusing on what I am currently working on/with.</p>&#13;
<p>This will deprecate my previous blog (which can be found at <a title="a peppy blog" href="pe.ppy.sh">pe.ppy.sh</a>). I considered migrating content, but after weighing up the pros and cons decided to leave it be and start fresh.</p>&#13;
<p>It shouldn't need to be said that the majority of the posts will be of technical nature, so if this frightens you, run away now. Run for the hills.</p>&#13;
<p><em>update</em>: looks as if <a target="_blank" href="http://blog.jethachan.net/">another friend</a> will be participating in this challenge too!</p>
