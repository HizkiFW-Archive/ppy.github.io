<p>I spend quite a bit of time setting up my development environment to a perfect state. I define a perfect state as one where I can innovate, create and debug without thinking about -- or being distracted by -- my input/output environment. There are quite a few separate elements I'd like to focus on and share, but this time around let's take a look at colours and syntax highlighting.</p>&#13;
<p>While I believe my colour scheme was originally based on another, I have unfortunately since lost its origins. It has been through many revisions over the years, but I have been using it for over a good length of time without any changes, so believe it is at a stable point to release!</p>&#13;

<p>You can download my visual studio 2010 colour settings <a href="http://puu.sh/4SN5">here</a>. Preferred colour schemes are quite a personal thing, so I'm interested in hearing about which parts people like/dislike about this scheme!</p>
